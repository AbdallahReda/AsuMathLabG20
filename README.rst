ASU Math Lab Software Project
=============================

Intro
-----

This project is made by a group of 3rd year Computer and systems depatrtment
students at Faculty of Engineering Ain Shams University.

This is a complete rewrite in C++. The aim of the software is to
simulating a program dealing with matrices and it's operations similar
to Matlab, Octave and similar tools.

ASU Math Lab Software will go through the following Phases:

- Core operations 
- Advanced Operations and Tuning 
- Advanced system operations


Phases 1: Core Operations
-------------------------

- Implement C++ class for matrix
- Support dynamic creation and destruction of matrices of any size
- Support addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose and division
- Process input user commands and show results directly
- Process input file, show each step result then exit)

Phases 2: Advanced Operations and Tuning 
----------------------------------------

- Support mathematical functions(Trigonometric, Logarithmic, Roots, Power).
- Support mathematical expressions(Either with (dot) or not).
- Support flexible matrix parser(Accept matrix in matrix, expressions and variables).
- Support error handling(Do not crash for invalid input).

Phases 3: Advanced system operations 
------------------------------------
- Soon

Input Format
------------

- User can write directly in the CommandLine or typing in afile

- The inputs should be similar to the following format(MATLAB Format): 

Example For Phase1 format:
::
                              
> A = [1.4 2.2 3.2; 4.4 5.4 6.4; 3.3 4.2 2.2]; //Defining the first matrix A
> B = [1.5 4.1 5.4; 3.1 4.2 1.2; 3.2 4.3 2.2]; //Defining the second matrix B
> C = A + B //Adding two matrices and put result in a matrix C
> D = A - B //Subtracting two matrices and put result in a matrix D
> E = A * B //Mul two matrices and put result in a matrix E
> F = A / B //Div two matrices and put result in a matrix F
> G = Aâ€™    //Trasnpose matrix A and put result in a matrix H

Example For Phase2 format:

::  
                         
> A = 5.5 + 12 * sin(0.4) + 2.2^4; //Support Trigonometric functions like sin,cos,...

> B = [1.2 2.3 A;[1.3 2.4;4.6 1.3],[3.2;7.8]]; //Accept matrix in matrix ,expressions and variables

> C = [[B [3.4; 2.1; 3.5+9.1]]

> 1.2^3 3+1.2 15/(2.1+10*sin(0.12)) 1.2]

> D = rand(4,4) //Create random matrix with size 4x4

> E = eye(4, 4) //Create eye matrix with size 4x4

> F = zeros(2, 3) //Create zero matrix with size 2x3

> G = ones(3, 6) //Create ones matrix with size 3x6

> L = (1.2 + 3.4 - 5.6)/(2.1*3.2 + 4.6) - 12.1*3.1 + (1.2 + 5.2)^(4/(3.2+5.6)) //Support Support mathematical functions

> X = ((C*D .+ 4)./2.1 + sqrt(D))./C.^2

> Y = (C^3 * sin(1./D))^(0.1)

Example for Phase3 format:
